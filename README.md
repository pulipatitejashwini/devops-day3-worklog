# Task 3: Networking Basics for DevOps

# Overview
This task focuses on understanding basic networking concepts required for DevOps engineers.              
I explored IP addressing, connectivity testing, open ports, DNS resolution, and network path tracing using Linux command-line tools.                              

## Tools Used
- Linux CLI (Ubuntu)                   
- Commands: ip, ping, ss, netstat, nslookup, dig, traceroute                       
  
# Topics Covered
- IP Addressing                
- Network Connectivity Testing                 
- Open Ports and Services                 
- DNS Resolution                   
- Network Path Tracing              
- Network Failure Simulation                          

# Deliverables
- Network Analysis Report                      
- Screenshots of command outputs                
  
# Outcome 
This task helped me understand how systems communicate over networks and how to troubleshoot common networking issues, which is essential for DevOps and Cloud roles.
